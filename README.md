## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During the challenge, I learned to apply the main and footer semantic tags correctly. Previously, I relied exclusively on div elements for structural layout, but incorporating semantic HTML improved the readability and maintainability of the project, if necessary.

On the CSS side, learn Flexbox was crucial for replicating the layout as closely as possible to the design specifications provided in the challenge.

**Note: I intentionally retained the original footer structure from the challenge’s HTML in order to include my name on the project. Although it was not part of the proposed design, I positioned it discreetly at the bottom of the page to minimize visual impact.**

To illustrate, here’s how the footer was implemented in the code:

```html
<footer>
    Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>.
    Coded by <a href="#">Kaique Neves</a>.
  </footer>
```
```css
footer {
    font-size: 11px;
    text-align: center;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I recognize the importance of continuing to improve my CSS skills, particularly in making my workflow more fluid and intuitive when writing styles. My goal is to write CSS in a way that is both efficient and maintainable, enhancing productivity and reducing refactoring time.

Feedbacks are very welcome!
